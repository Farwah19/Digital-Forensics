# 🔍 Forensics of Windows & Kali Linux

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **digital forensics techniques** using **Windows and Kali Linux**. It involves forensic analysis of **disk images, memory dumps, registry files, network traffic, Android & iOS devices**, and **malware investigations** using industry-standard tools.

## ⚡ Key Investigations
- **Forensic Image Analysis** – Investigating disk images with **Autopsy** to extract hidden artifacts.
- **Network Forensics** – Analyzing **PCAP files** with **Wireshark** to extract credentials and detect attacks.
- **Memory Forensics** – Extracting sensitive data from memory dumps using **Autopsy & Volatility**.
- **Email Forensics** – Tracing phishing and cybercrimes through email headers and logs.
- **Android & iOS Forensics** – Analyzing mobile device data, app usage, and GPS tracking.
- **Malware Investigation** – Examining **PUPs, RATs, and BOTs** using **Velociraptor & Sysmon**.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Autopsy** – Digital forensic tool for analyzing disk images.
- **Wireshark** – Network traffic analysis for extracting credentials and investigating threats.
- **Velociraptor** – Threat hunting & incident response for malware analysis.
- **Kali Linux** – Security & penetration testing environment.
- **FTK Imager** – Evidence collection & forensic imaging.
- **Sysmon & Windows Event Logs** – Tracking system events for forensic investigations.
